# MSG_SERVER
Messaging application - UX and Source Code

-----

This program is a complete messageing application built around my MsgServer.cs file and communicates with connected client applications (https://github.com/Tornadocraver/MSG_CLIENT/). Please note that this project is still in the testing phase and may have some issues (although you are welcome to test it). Any questens or suggestions, send me an email as: micahmail9@gmail.com

Future Plans:
		- Bug fixes
    - Make more user friendly (update UX)
    - Comment on code, make understandable
    - Implement File transfering
    - Implement Image transfering
    - Implement Voice streaming (VoIP)
    - Implement Video streaming (2-way)
    - (Possibly) rewrite messaging code for a third time
